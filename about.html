                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>My name is Anya Krishnamony, and I currently am a rising junior at Hopkinton High School in MA. Some of my interests other than cooking and coding include drawing, watching TV, running, and reading! I have one adorable dog named Oblo who enjoys eating some of my food even more than I do!</p>
                <p>Some of my friends refer to me as the "mom" of our group because I insist on cooking them heartwarming meals and continue to provide them with some of my favorite recipes.</p>
                <p>I created this blog in May 2022 as a computer science project, but I continue to add and edit this blog as needed. Both cooking and coding are some of my few passions and my favorite thing to do is share it with the world.</p>
