                <h3>My Top 5 Cooking Tips</h3>
                <h4>Sunday, June 5, 2022</h4>
                
                <p>When I tell people I'm a cook, I always get questions about how to get more into cooking or how to improve on it. Firstly, the only way to get better at cooking is by practicing. It isn't a one time achievement, it take repetition and practice. However, I have putlined some essential skills that I beleive every aspiring chef should know. </p>
                <h5>Allow flavor to infuse with oils.</h5>
                <p>What I mean by this is allow ingredients like seasonings, diced garlic, and onions to saut√© with oils before adding any other ingredients. The oil pulls away their flavor and essentialy infuses it with its taste, and you can use this oil in the rest of your recipe to make that even more flavorful. </p>

                <h5>Add oilve oil to boiling water with grains.</h5>
                <p>Grains like rice and pasta are always sticking together. As you're heating up your water for these dishes, consider adding a little olive oil into the water along with salt to prevent sticking.</p>
                
                <h5>Invest in a cast iron.</h5>
                <p>Cast iron pans are one of the best pans I've ever used. They're pricy, but so worth it. Heat doesn't fluctuate with a cast iron; once it get's hot, it stays hot. It's non stick. I might be exaggerating, but I feel like cast iron pans cut down the cooking time of my recipes in half. What's not to love? The only pain of it is how heavy some of the good ones are</p>
                
                <h5>Master basic knife skills.</h5>
                <p>This is kind of a given. Just know how to slice well, dice finely, chop herbs, and how to not cut yourself. Other than that, you should be fine. Trust me, it's much better to know now then to get into a recipe and not know what you're doing.</p>
                
                <h5>Clean as you go.</h5>
                <p>This is definetley my number 1 rule for cooking. It is so helpful to clean dishes and utensils as I'm cooking, especially when it's an intricate and task-heavy recipe. An added bonus is that you're actually able to enjoy your dish after cooking rather than stressing about cleaning. And for me personally, I just think it's nice to work in a clean workspace and always make sure to clean before I start. Sometimes I even vacuum.</p>
